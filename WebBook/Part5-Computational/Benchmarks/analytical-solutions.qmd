## Introduction

Analytical solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are rare and precious. They serve multiple critical purposes in computational geodynamics:

1. **Code Validation**: Compare numerical solutions against exact analytical results to verify implementation correctness
2. **Convergence Testing**: Measure numerical error as a function of resolution to confirm expected convergence rates
3. **Physical Intuition**: Build understanding of viscous flow behavior through exact solutions
4. **Benchmark Standards**: Establish community-accepted test cases for comparing different numerical methods

This chapter presents a collection of analytical solutions for viscous flows, focusing on one-dimensional problems where the nonlinear advection term vanishes, making exact solutions possible. While these flows are geometrically simple, they capture essential physics relevant to geodynamics:

- **Couette flow**: Simple shear, analogous to lithospheric deformation
- **Poiseuille flow**: Pressure-driven flow, relevant to channel flows and magma transport
- **Pipe flow**: Axisymmetric geometry, applicable to cylindrical conduits
- **Oscillating boundaries**: Time-dependent flows with diffusion

## Material adapted from MTH3360 Fluid Mechanics

## One-Dimensional Flows

### Why the Nonlinear Term Vanishes

The central difficulty in solving the Navier-Stokes equations lies in the nonlinear advection term $(\uv \cdot \GRAD) \uv$. However, in one-dimensional flows where only a single component of velocity is non-zero, say $\uv = (0, 0, w)$, this term vanishes.

From continuity (incompressibility):
$$
\DIV \uv = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = 0
$$

Since $u = v = 0$, we have $\partial w / \partial z = 0$, meaning $w$ is independent of $z$. Therefore:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\uv \cdot \GRAD) \uv &= \left( u\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right) (u, v, w) \\
&= \left( 0, 0, w\frac{\partial w}{\partial z} \right) \\
&= \mathbf{0}
\end{aligned}
$$

This linearization allows us to find exact analytical solutions to many problems.

## Steady Plane Couette Flow

### Problem Statement

Consider steady viscous flow between two parallel rigid plates:

- Lower plate at $z = 0$: fixed ($\uv = \mathbf{0}$)
- Upper plate at $z = h$: moving with velocity $(U, 0, 0)$
- Flow independent of $x$ and $y$ directions
- No applied pressure gradient

![Couette flow: Linear velocity profile between moving plates](../../Images/Diagrams/couette-flow.png){#fig-couette width=450px}

### Solution

From the symmetry assumptions and continuity, we know:
- $w = 0$ everywhere
- $\uv = (u(z), 0, 0)$

The Navier-Stokes equations reduce to:
$$
0 = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \nu\frac{d^2 u}{dz^2}
$$

Since there's no applied pressure gradient in the $x$-direction, $\partial p/\partial x = 0$, giving:
$$
\frac{d^2 u}{dz^2} = 0
$$

This integrates to:
$$
u = Az + B
$$

Applying boundary conditions:
- At $z = 0$: $u = 0 \Rightarrow B = 0$
- At $z = h$: $u = U \Rightarrow A = U/h$

**Analytical Solution:**
$$
u(z) = U\frac{z}{h}
$$ {#eq-couette-solution}

### Physical Interpretation

- **Velocity profile**: Linear from $0$ to $U$
- **Vorticity**: Constant throughout the fluid, $\omega = \partial u/\partial z = U/h$
- **Shear stress**: Constant, $\tau = \mu(du/dz) = \mu U/h$
- **Stress transmission**: The tangential stress exerted by the upper plate is transmitted without change to the lower plate

### Geodynamic Relevance

Couette flow is the fundamental model for:
- Simple shear deformation in the lithosphere
- Shear zones in the mantle
- Flow between tectonic plates
- Laboratory experiments (rotary shear apparatus)

## Steady Plane Poiseuille Flow

### Problem Statement

Steady viscous flow driven by a pressure gradient between two parallel fixed plates:

- Both plates at $z = 0$ and $z = h$: no-slip ($\uv = \mathbf{0}$)
- Applied pressure gradient: $dp/dx < 0$ (pressure decreases in flow direction)
- Flow independent of $x$ and $y$ positions

![Poiseuille flow: Parabolic velocity profile in pressure-driven channel flow](../../Images/Diagrams/poiseuille-flow.png){#fig-poiseuille width=450px}

### Solution

From continuity and boundary conditions:
- $w = 0$ everywhere
- $\uv = (u(z), 0, 0)$

The Navier-Stokes equations give:
$$
0 = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \nu\frac{d^2 u}{dz^2}
$$

Now $p = p(x)$ only, and $u = u(z)$ only. Both sides must equal a constant. Let:
$$
\frac{dp}{dx} = -\gamma \quad \text{(constant)}
$$

where $\gamma > 0$ for flow in the positive $x$-direction. Then:
$$
\frac{d^2 u}{dz^2} = -\frac{\gamma}{\mu}
$$

Integrating twice:
$$
u = -\frac{\gamma}{2\mu}z^2 + Az + B
$$

Applying boundary conditions:
- At $z = 0$: $u = 0 \Rightarrow B = 0$
- At $z = h$: $u = 0 \Rightarrow A = \gamma h/(2\mu)$

**Analytical Solution:**
$$
u(z) = \frac{\gamma}{2\mu}z(h - z)
$$ {#eq-poiseuille-solution}

### Physical Interpretation

- **Velocity profile**: Parabolic with maximum at $z = h/2$
- **Maximum velocity**: $u_{max} = \gamma h^2/(8\mu)$
- **Volume flux per unit width**: $Q = \int_0^h u \, dz = \gamma h^3/(12\mu)$
- **Shear stress**: $\tau = \gamma(h - 2z)/2$, zero at centerline, maximum at walls
- **Vorticity**: $\omega = \gamma(h - 2z)/(2\mu)$, positive at lower wall, negative at upper wall

### Geodynamic Relevance

Poiseuille flow models:
- Channel flows in the mantle
- Flow in magma-filled fractures and dikes
- Pressure-driven flow in laboratory experiments
- Return flow in subduction zones

## Axisymmetric Pipe Flow (Hagen-Poiseuille Flow)

### Problem Statement

Steady viscous flow through a cylindrical pipe of radius $a$ under a constant applied pressure gradient:

- No-slip boundary condition at $r = a$: $w = 0$
- Axisymmetric flow: no dependence on $\theta$
- Applied pressure gradient: $dp/dz = -\gamma$

![Pipe flow: Parabolic velocity profile in a circular pipe](../../Images/Diagrams/pipe-flow.png){#fig-pipe-flow width=350px}

### Solution

In cylindrical coordinates $(r, \theta, z)$, assume $\mathbf{U} = (u(r), 0, w(r))$.

From continuity in cylindrical coordinates:
$$
\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(ru) + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = 0
$$

Since $w = w(r)$ only, this gives $u(r) = 0$.

The momentum balance in the $z$-direction becomes:
$$
-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} + \frac{\nu}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r\frac{dw}{dr}\right) = 0
$$

Since $p = p(z)$ only and $w = w(r)$ only:
$$
\frac{dp}{dz} = -\gamma \quad \text{(constant)}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r\frac{dw}{dr}\right) = -\frac{\gamma}{\mu}
$$

The general solution is:
$$
w = -\frac{\gamma r^2}{4\mu} + A\ln r + B
$$

Boundary conditions:
- Finite at $r = 0$: $A = 0$
- $w(a) = 0$: $B = \gamma a^2/(4\mu)$

**Analytical Solution:**
$$
w(r) = \frac{\gamma a^2}{4\mu}\left(1 - \frac{r^2}{a^2}\right)
$$ {#eq-pipe-flow-solution}

### Physical Interpretation

- **Velocity profile**: Parabolic in $r$
- **Maximum velocity**: $w_{max} = \gamma a^2/(4\mu)$ at $r = 0$
- **Volume flux**: $Q = \int_0^a w \cdot 2\pi r \, dr = \pi\gamma a^4/(8\mu)$
- **Average velocity**: $\bar{w} = Q/(\pi a^2) = \gamma a^2/(8\mu) = w_{max}/2$

### Geodynamic Relevance

Pipe flow is relevant to:
- Magma ascent through cylindrical conduits
- Fluid flow in porous media (Darcy flow in cylindrical pores)
- Laboratory experiments with cylindrical geometry
- Core dynamics in cylindrical coordinates

## Mixed Couette-Poiseuille Flow

### Problem Statement

Flow driven by both a moving upper plate and a pressure gradient:

- Lower plate at $z = 0$: fixed
- Upper plate at $z = h$: velocity $(U, 0, 0)$
- Applied pressure gradient: $dp/dx = -\gamma$

This combines simple shear and pressure-driven flow.

### Solution

The governing equation is:
$$
\frac{d^2 u}{dz^2} = -\frac{\gamma}{\mu}
$$

with boundary conditions $u(0) = 0$ and $u(h) = U$.

**Analytical Solution:**
$$
u(z) = \frac{\gamma}{2\mu}z(h - z) + U\frac{z}{h}
$$ {#eq-mixed-flow-solution}

This is simply the superposition of Poiseuille flow @eq-poiseuille-solution and Couette flow @eq-couette-solution.

### Zero Net Flux Condition

The volume flux per unit width is:
$$
Q = \int_0^h u \, dz = \frac{\gamma h^3}{12\mu} + \frac{Uh}{2}
$$

For zero net flux ($Q = 0$), the required pressure gradient is:
$$
\gamma = -\frac{6\mu U}{h^2}
$$

The negative value indicates the pressure gradient opposes the plate motion.

## Time-Dependent Problems

### Oscillating Plate (Stokes' Second Problem)

An incompressible fluid occupies the half-space $z > 0$ above a rigid boundary at $z = 0$ that oscillates with velocity $U\cos(\alpha t)$.

The velocity field $\uv = (u(z,t), 0, 0)$ satisfies:
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nu\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}
$$ {#eq-diffusion-equation}

This is the heat/diffusion equation with kinematic viscosity $\nu$ playing the role of thermal diffusivity.

Seeking a solution of the form $u = \text{Re}\{f(z)e^{i\alpha t}\}$ and requiring $u \to 0$ as $z \to \infty$:

**Analytical Solution:**
$$
u(z,t) = Ue^{-kz}\cos(kz - \alpha t)
$$ {#eq-oscillating-plate-solution}

where $k = \sqrt{\alpha/(2\nu)}$ is the inverse penetration depth.

### Physical Interpretation

- **Penetration depth**: $\delta = 1/k = \sqrt{2\nu/\alpha}$
- Velocity amplitude decays exponentially with distance from the plate
- Phase lag increases linearly with distance
- At distance $z = \pi/k$, the fluid moves in the opposite direction to the plate

This solution demonstrates **viscous diffusion** of momentum from the oscillating boundary into the fluid.

## Solutions to Selected Exercises

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution to Exercise 1: Mixed Couette-Poiseuille Flow

**(a) Velocity profile:**

The governing equation is:
$$
\frac{d^2 u}{dz^2} = -\frac{\gamma}{\mu}
$$

Integrating twice:
$$
u = -\frac{\gamma}{2\mu}z^2 + Az + B
$$

Boundary conditions:
- At $z = 0$: $u = 0 \Rightarrow B = 0$
- At $z = h$: $u = U \Rightarrow A = U/h + \gamma h/(2\mu)$

Therefore:
$$
u(z) = \frac{z}{h}\left(U + \frac{\gamma h^2}{2\mu}\right) - \frac{\gamma z^2}{2\mu}
$$

Since the pressure gradient **opposes** the plate motion ($\gamma > 0$), the term $-\gamma z^2/(2\mu)$ reduces the velocity.

**(b) Volume flux:**

$$
Q = \int_0^h u \, dz = \frac{Uh}{2} + \frac{\gamma h^3}{12\mu} - \frac{\gamma h^3}{6\mu} = \frac{Uh}{2} - \frac{\gamma h^3}{12\mu}
$$

**(c) Zero flux condition:**

Setting $Q = 0$:
$$
\frac{Uh}{2} = \frac{\gamma h^3}{12\mu}
$$

$$
\gamma = \frac{6\mu U}{h^2}
$$

This is the pressure gradient magnitude required to exactly oppose the plate-driven flow.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution to Exercise 3: Cylindrical Pipe Flow

**(a) Continuity:**

In cylindrical coordinates:
$$
\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(ru_r) + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} = 0
$$

Since we assume $u_z = u_z(r)$ only (axisymmetric, fully-developed flow), $\partial u_z/\partial z = 0$, which gives:
$$
\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}(ru_r) = 0
$$

Integrating: $ru_r = \text{constant}$. Since $u_r$ must be finite at $r = 0$, the constant must be zero, so $u_r = 0$.

**(b) Governing equation:**

The $z$-component of the Navier-Stokes equation (steady, axisymmetric) is:
$$
-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} + \frac{\nu}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r\frac{du_z}{dr}\right) = 0
$$

Since $p = p(z)$ and $u_z = u_z(r)$:
$$
\frac{dp}{dz} = -\gamma \quad \text{(constant)}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r\frac{du_z}{dr}\right) = -\frac{\gamma}{\mu}
$$

**(c) Solution:**

Integrating once:
$$
r\frac{du_z}{dr} = -\frac{\gamma r^2}{2\mu} + C_1
$$

For finite velocity at $r = 0$: $C_1 = 0$. Integrating again:
$$
u_z = -\frac{\gamma r^2}{4\mu} + C_2
$$

Boundary condition $u_z(a) = 0$ gives $C_2 = \gamma a^2/(4\mu)$:
$$
u_z(r) = \frac{\gamma a^2}{4\mu}\left(1 - \frac{r^2}{a^2}\right)
$$

**(d) Volume flux:**

$$
Q = \int_0^a u_z \cdot 2\pi r \, dr = 2\pi\frac{\gamma a^2}{4\mu}\int_0^a \left(1 - \frac{r^2}{a^2}\right)r \, dr
$$

$$
Q = \frac{\pi\gamma a^2}{2\mu}\left[\frac{r^2}{2} - \frac{r^4}{4a^2}\right]_0^a = \frac{\pi\gamma a^4}{8\mu}
$$

**(e) Velocity comparison:**

- Maximum velocity: $u_{max} = \gamma a^2/(4\mu)$ at $r = 0$
- Average velocity: $\bar{u} = Q/(\pi a^2) = \gamma a^2/(8\mu)$
- Ratio: $\bar{u}/u_{max} = 1/2$

The average velocity is exactly half the maximum velocity for parabolic pipe flow.

## Solution to Exercise 4: Vorticity in Poiseuille Flow

**(a) Vorticity distribution:**

For plane Poiseuille flow @eq-poiseuille-solution:
$$
u = \frac{\gamma z}{2\mu}(h - z)
$$

The vorticity (for 2D flow in the $x$-$z$ plane) is:
$$
\omega = \frac{du}{dz} = \frac{\gamma}{2\mu}(h - 2z)
$$

At the boundaries:
- At $z = 0$: $\omega = \gamma h/(2\mu) > 0$ (positive vorticity)
- At $z = h$: $\omega = -\gamma h/(2\mu) < 0$ (negative vorticity)
- At $z = h/2$: $\omega = 0$ (vorticity cancels)

**(b) Mechanism:**

Vorticity is generated at solid boundaries through the no-slip condition. The boundary continuously generates vorticity that diffuses into the interior. The rate of vorticity generation is proportional to the velocity gradient at the wall.

**(c-d) Time-dependent problem:**

For the impulsive start problem, let $\uv = (u(z,t), 0, 0)$. From continuity: $w = 0$.

The $x$-momentum equation is:
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{dp_0}{dx} + \nu\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}
$$

Since $dp_0/dx = -\gamma$ (constant), this is:
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\gamma}{\rho} + \nu\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}
$$

**(e) Initial condition:**

At $t = 0$, the fluid is at rest: $u(z, 0) = 0$. The boundary conditions are $u(0,t) = u(h,t) = 0$ for all $t > 0$.

The steady-state solution is the Poiseuille profile. The unsteady solution approaches this as $t \to \infty$.

1. **One-dimensional flows** provide exact solutions because the nonlinear advection term vanishes
2. **Couette flow** (simple shear) and **Poiseuille flow** (pressure-driven) are fundamental building blocks
3. **Cylindrical geometries** (pipe flow) extend these concepts to axisymmetric cases
4. **Time-dependent problems** demonstrate viscous diffusion of momentum
5. **Numerical validation** against these solutions is essential for code verification

In the following chapters, we will use these benchmark problems to validate more complex numerical methods including finite differences, finite elements, and spectral methods.
