## Welcome

This book develops a quantitative understanding of the dynamic processes within the Earth and sister planets. These processes are largely driven by the internal heat of the planet escaping to the surface. Some of this heat is left over from planetary formation, while the rest originates from the decay of radioactive elements.

Our approach combines:
- **Mathematical descriptions** of Earth's physical processes
- **Computational methods** to solve these equations numerically
- **Physical insight** into why planets behave as they do

## Book Structure

This book is organized into five main parts:

### Part I: Mathematical Fundamentals
The mathematical tools you need to understand geodynamics, including vector and tensor notation.

### Part II: Fluid Dynamics
The foundations of fluid mechanics and flow dynamics that govern mantle and planetary fluid motion.

### Part III: Geodynamics
Applications of fluid dynamics to planetary processes including mantle convection, plate tectonics, and lithospheric dynamics.

### Part IV: Numerical Methods
The computational techniques needed to solve the mathematical equations describing geodynamic processes.

### Part V: Computational Exercises
Practical examples and benchmarks demonstrating the concepts throughout the book.

## Who This Book Is For

This material is designed for advanced undergraduate or graduate students in:
- Geophysics and geodynamics
- Earth science
- Physics with planetary science interests
- Applied mathematics with Earth science applications

You will need:
- Basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra
- Familiarity with programming (preferably Python, but not essential)
- Curiosity about how planets work!

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter combines:
- **Conceptual explanations** of the physical and mathematical principles
- **Mathematical derivations** where you'll see where equations come from
- **Interactive code examples** that you can run directly in your browser
- **Exercises** to test your understanding

The interactive code examples use **Pyodide**, which runs Python directly in your browser via WebAssembly. You can modify the code and see results immediately without installing anything.

## What You'll Learn

By working through this book, you will understand:
- How to formulate mathematical models of physical processes
- How to solve these models computationally
- How these models help us understand planetary evolution
- How different planets can evolve along different paths
- How to build and validate your own geodynamic models

Let's get started with an introduction to what we mean by "modeling" in geodynamics.
