# Applications of Stokes Flow

{{< include ../_math-preamble.qmd >}}

A number of related solutions exist to problems such as unstable layering
breaking down, buckling of viscous layers and rebound of topography when
surface loading changes.

## Rayleigh-Taylor Instability & Diapirism

![Salt diapirs result when a buried layer of salt(a,b) becomes convectively unstable and rises through the overlying sediment layers (c,d). The idealized geometry for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem is outlined in the lower diagram.](../Images/Diagrams/diapirs.png){#fig-rayleigh-taylor width=450px}

Diapirism is the buoyant upwelling of rock which is lighter than its
surroundings. This can include mantle plumes and other purely thermal
phenomena but it often applied to compositionally distinct rock masses
such as melts infiltrating the crust (in the Archean) or salt rising
through denser sediments.

Salt layers may result from the evaporation of seawater. If subsequent
sedimentation covers the salt, a gravitionally unstable configuration
results with heavier material (sediments) on top of light material
(salt). The rheology of salt is distinctly non-linear and also sensitive
to temperature. Once buried, the increased temperature of the salt layer
causes its viscosity to decrease to the point where instabilities can
grow. Note, since there is always a strong density contrast between the
two rock types, the critical Rayleigh number argument does not apply --
this situation is always unstable, but instabilities can only grow at a
reasonable rate once the salt has become weak.

The geometry is outlined above in @fig-rayleigh-taylor. We
suppose initially that the surface is slightly perturbed with a form of

$$
w_m = w_{m0} \cos kx
$$

where $k$ is the wavenumber, $k=2\pi / \lambda$, $\lambda$ being the
wavelength of the disturbance. We assume that the magnitude of the
disturbance is always much smaller than the wavelength.

The problem is easiest to solve if we deal with the biharmonic equation
for the stream function. Experience leads us to try to separate
variables and look for solutions of the form

$$
\psi = \left( A \sin kx + B \cos kx \right ) Y(y)
$$

where the function $Y$ is to be determined. The form we have chosen for
$w_m$ in fact means $A=1,B=0$ which we can assume from now on to
simplify the algebra.

Substituting the trial solution for $\psi$ into the biharmonic equation
gives

$$
\frac{d^4 Y}{d y^4} -2k^2 \frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2} +k^4 Y = 0
$$

which has solutions of the form

$$
Y = A \exp(m y)
$$

where $A$ is an arbitrary constant. Subtituting gives us an equation for $m$

$$
m^4 - 2 k^2 m^2 + k^4 = (m^2 - k^2)^2 = 0
$$ {#eq-diapaux}

or

$$
m = \pm k
$$

Because we have degenerate eigenvalues (i.e. of the four possible
solutions to the auxilliary equation
@eq-diapaux,
two pairs are equal) we need to extend the
form of the solution to

$$
Y = (By+A) \exp(m y)
$$

to give the general
form of the solution in this situation to be

$$
\begin{aligned}
            \psi &= \sin kx \left( A e^{-ky} + B y e^{-ky} + C e^{ky} + D y e^{ky} \right)
\\
        \mathrm{or, equivalently}
            \psi &= \sin kx \left( A_1 \cosh ky + B_1 \sinh ky + C_1 y \cosh ky + D_1 y \sinh ky  \right)
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-biharmsoln2}

This equation applies in each of the layers separately. We therefore
need to find two sets of constants $\{A_1,B_1,C_1,D_1\}$ and
$\{A_2,B_2,C_3,D_4\}$ by the application of suitable boundary
conditions. These are known in terms of the velocities in each layer,
$\mathbf{v}_1 = \mathbf{i} u_1 +\mathbf{j} v_1$ and
$\mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{i} u_2 +\mathbf{j} v_2$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
                u_1 = v_1 &= 0 \mathrm{\hspace{1cm} on \hspace{1cm}} y = -b \\
                u_2 = v_2 &= 0 \mathrm{\hspace{1cm} on \hspace{1cm}} y = b
\end{aligned}
$$

together with a continuity condition across the interface (which we
assume is imperceptibly deformed

$$
u_1 = u_2  \mathrm{\hspace{1cm} and \hspace{1cm}}
                v_1 = v_2 \mathrm{\hspace{1cm} on \hspace{1cm}} y = 0
$$

The shear stress ($\sigma_{xy}$) should also be continuous across the
interface, which, if we assume equal viscosities, gives

$$
\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x} =
    \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x} \mathrm{\hspace{1cm} on \hspace{1cm}} y = 0
$$

and, to simplify matters, if the velocity is continuous across $y=0$
then any velocity derivatives in the $x$ direction evaluated at $y=0$
will also be continuous (i.e.
$\partial v_2 / \partial x = \partial v_1 / \partial x$).

The expressions for velocity in terms of the solution
@eq-biharmsoln2 are

$$
\begin{aligned}
    u  = -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} & = -\sin kx \left(
                    (A_1 k + D_1 + C_1 k y) \sinh ky + (B_1 k + C_1 + D_1 ky) \cosh ky  \right) \\
    v  = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} & = k \cos kx \left(
                    (A_1 +C_1 y)\cosh ky + (B_1 +D_1 y)  \sinh ky   \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

From here to the solution requires much tedious rearrangement, and the
usual argument based on the arbitrary choice of wavenumber $k$ but we
finally arrive at

$$
\begin{gathered}
            \psi_1 = A_1 \sin kx \cosh ky + \\
                            A_1 \sin kx \left[
                                \frac{y}{k b^2} \tanh kb \sinh ky +
                                        \left( \frac{y}{b} \cosh ky    \frac{1}{kb} \sinh ky \right) \cdot
                                        \left( \frac{1}{kb} +
                                        \frac{1}{\sinh bk \cosh bk} \right) \right] \times \\
                            \left[ \frac{1}{\sinh bk \cosh bk} - \frac{1}{(b^2k^2} \tanh bk \right] ^{-1}
\end{gathered}
$$ {#eq-raytays1}

The stream function for the lower layer is
found by replacing $y$ with $-y$ in this equation. This is already a
relatively nasty expression, but we haven't finished since the constant
$A_1$ remains. This occurs because we have so far considered the form of
flows which satisfy all the boundary conditions but have not yet
considered what drives the flow in each layer.

To eliminate $A_1$, we have to consider the physical scales inherent in
the problem itself. We are interested (primarily) in the behaviour of
the interface which moves with a velocity $\partial w / \partial t$. As
we are working with small deflections of the interface,

$$
\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} = \left. v \right|_{y=0}
$$

![The restoring force for a stable layering is proportional to the excess density when a fluid element is displaced across the boundary.](../Images/Diagrams/diapir2.png){#fig-rayleigh-taylor-2 width=450px}

Consider what happens when the fluid above the interface is lighter than
the fluid below -- this situation is stable so we expect the layering to
be preserved, and if the interface is disturbed the disturbance to
decay. This implies that there must be a restoring force acting on an
element of fluid which is somehow displaced across the boundary at $y=0$
(@fig-rayleigh-taylor-2).

This restoring force is due to the density difference between the
displaced material and the layer in which it finds itself. The
expression for the force is exactly that from Archimedes principle which
explains how a boat can float (only in the opposite direction)

$$
\left. F_2 \right|_{y=0} = \delta x g w (\rho_2 - \rho_1)
$$

which can
be expressed as a normal stress difference (assumed to apply, once
again, at the boundary). The viscous component of the normal stress
turns out to be zero -- proven by evaluating $\partial v / \partial y$
at $y=0$ using the expression for $\phi$ in equation
@eq-raytays1. Thus the restoring stress is purely pressure

$$
\left. P_2 \right|_{y=0} = g w (\rho_2 - \rho_1)
$$

The pressure in terms of the solution (so far) for $\psi$ is found from
the equation of motion in the horizontal direction (substituting the
stream function formulation) and is then equated to the restoring
pressure above.

$$
(\rho_1-\rho_2) g w = -\frac{4 \eta k A_1}{b} \cos kx
    \left(\frac{1}{kb} + \frac{1}{\sinh bk \cosh bk} \right) \cdot
    \left(   \frac{1}{\sinh bk \cosh bk} - \frac{1}{(b^2k^2} \tanh bk \right)^{-1}
$$

which allows us to substitute for $A_1$ in our expression for
$\partial w / \partial t$ above. Since $A_1$ is independent of $t$, we
can see that the solution for $w$ will be of a growing or decaying
exponential form with growth/decay constant coming from the argument
above.

$$
w(t) = w_0 \exp((t-t_0)/\tau)
$$

where

$$
\tau = \frac{4 \eta}{(\rho_1-\rho_2) g b}
        \left( \frac{1}{kb} + \frac{1}{\sinh bk \cosh bk} \right) \cdot
        \left(   \frac{1}{k^2b^2} \tanh kb - \frac{1}{\sinh kb \cosh kb}     \right)^{-1}
$$

So, finally, an answer -- the rate at which instabilities on the
interface between two layers will grow (or shrink) which depends on
viscosity, layer depth and density differences, together with the
geometrical consideration of the layer thicknesses.

A stable layering results from light fluid resting on heavy fluid; a
heavy fluid resting on a light fluid is always unstable (no critical
Rayleigh number applies) although the growth rate can be so small that
no deformation occurs in practice. The growth rate is also dependent on
wavenumber. There is a minimum in the growth time as a function of
dimensional wavenumber which occurs at $k b = 2.4$, so instabilities
close to this wavenumber are expected to grow first and dominate.

Remember that this derivation is simplified for fluids of equal
viscosity, and layers of identical depth. Remember also that the
solution is for infinitessimal deformations of the interface. If the
deformation grows then the approximations of small deformation no longer
hold. This gives a clue as to how difficulties dealing with the
advection term of the transport equations arise.

At some point it becomes impossible to obtain meaningful results without
computer simulation. However, plenty of further work has already been
done on this area for non-linear fluids, temperature dependent viscosity
&c and the solutions are predictably long and tedious to read, much less
solve. When the viscosity is not constant, the use of a stream function
notation is not particularly helpful as the biharmonic form no longer
appears.

The methodology used here is instructive, as it can be used in a number
of different applications to related areas. The equations are similar,
the boundary conditions different.

## Post-Glacial Rebound

![The relaxation of the Earth's surface after removal of an ice load.](../Images/Diagrams/postglac.png){#fig-post-glacial width=450px}

In the postglacial rebound problem, consider a viscous half space with
an imposed topography at $t=0$. The ice load is removed at $t=0$ and the
interface relaxes back to its original flat state.

This can be studied one wavenumber at a time --- computing a decay rate
for each component of the topography. The intial loading is computed
from the fourier transform of the ice bottom topography.

The system is similar to that of the diapirs except that the loading is
now applied to one surface rather than the interface between two fluids.

## Phase Changes in the mantle

A different interface problem is that of mantle phase changes. Here a
bouyancy anomaly results if the phase change boundary is distorted. This
can result from advection normal to the boundary bringing cooler or
warmer material across the boundary.

The buoyancy balance argument used above can be recycled here to
determine a scaling for the ability of plumes/downwellings to cross the
phase boundary.

## Kernels for Surface Observables

The solution method used for the Rayleigh Taylor problem can also be
used in determining spectral Green's functions for mantle flow in
response to thermal perturbations. This is a particularly abstract
application of the identical theory.

## Folding of Layered (Viscous) Medium

![Instability in a thin, viscous layer compressed from both ends.](../Images/Diagrams/fold.png){#fig-folding width=450px}

If a thin viscous layer is compressed from one end then it may develop
buckling instabilities in which velocities grow perpendicular to the
plane of the layer.

If the layer is embedded between two semi-infinite layers of viscous
fluid with viscosity much smaller than the viscosity of the layer, then
Biot theory tells us the wavelength of the initial buckling instability,
and the rate at which it grows.

The fold geometry evolves as

$$
w=w_m \cos(kx) e^{\frac{t}{\tau_a}}
$$

where

$$
\tau_a = \frac{1}{\bar{P}}\left[ \frac{4 \eta_0}{k} + \frac{\eta_1 h^3}{3k^2} \right]
$$

and the fastest growing wavenumber is

$$
k = \frac{6}{h}\left( \frac{\eta_1}{\eta_0} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$

For large deformations we eventually must resort to numerical
simulation.

## Gravity Currents

![A gravity current is the spreading of a dense fluid under its own weight across a horizontal surface (or a buoyant fluid under a surface). Open the fridge door and the cold air falls out as a gravity current.](../Images/Diagrams/gravcurr.png){#fig-gravity-current width=450px}

Gravity currents can occur when a viscous fluid flows under its own
weight as shown in @fig-gravity-current.

We assume that the fluid has constant viscosity, $\eta$ and that the
length of the current is considerably greater than its height. The fluid
is embedded in a low viscosity medium of density $\rho-\Delta \rho$
where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid itself.

The force balance is between buoyancy and viscosity. The assumptions of
geometry allow us to simplify the Stokes equation by assuming horizontal
pressure gradients due to the surface slope drive the flow.

$$
\nabla p = \eta\nabla^2 u \approx   g \Delta \rho \frac{\partial h}{\partial x}
$$

We assume near-zero shear stress at the top of the current to give

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial z} (x,h,t) = 0
$$

and zero velocity at the
base of the current. Hence

$$
u(x,z,t) = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{g \Delta \rho}{\eta} \frac{\partial h}{\partial x}  z(2h-z)
$$

Continuity integrated over depth implies

$$
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial }{\partial x} \int_0^h u dz = 0
$$

Combining these equations gives

$$
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} -\frac{1}{3} \frac{g \Delta \rho}{\eta}
                     \frac{\partial }{\partial x}  \left( h^3 \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} \right) = 0
$$

Finally, a global constraint fixes the total amount of fluid at any
given time

$$
\int_0^{x_N(t)} h(x,t)dx = qt^\alpha
$$

The latter term
being a fluid source at the origin, and $x_{N(t)}$ the location of the
front of the current. A similarity variable is the key to solving this problem:

$$
\nu = \left( \frac{1}{3} g\Delta \rho q^3 / \eta \right)^{-\frac{1}{5}} x t^{-(3\alpha +1) / 5}
$$

giving a solution of the form

$$
h(x,t) = \nu_N^{2/3} (3q^2 \eta / (g\Delta\rho))^{1/5} t^{(2\alpha -1) / 5} \phi(\nu/\nu_N)
$$

where $\nu_N$ is the value of $\nu$ at $x=x_N(t)$. Substituting into the
equation for $\partial h / \partial t$ we find that $\phi(\nu/\nu_N)$
satisfies

$$
\phi({\nu}/{\nu_N}) = \left[ \frac{3}{5}(3\alpha+1)\right]^{\frac{1}{3}}
                \left(1-\frac{\nu}{\nu_N} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \left[
                1 - \frac{3\alpha-4}{24(3\alpha+1)}\left(1-\frac{\nu}{\nu_N} \right) + O \left(1-\frac{\nu}{\nu_N} \right)^2
                \right]
$$

Which has an analytic solution if $\alpha=0$
(only constant sources or sinks)

$$
\begin{split}
            \phi({\nu}/{\nu_N}) &= \left( \frac{3}{10}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
            \left( 1-\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_N}\right)^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}  \\
        \nu_N &= \left[ \frac{1}{5} \left( \frac{3}{10}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}  \pi^{\frac{1}{2}}
    \Gamma (1/3) / \Gamma (5/6) \right]^{-\frac{3}{5}} = 1.411
\end{split}
$$

For all other values of $\alpha$ numerical
integration schemes must be used for $\phi$.

It is also possible to obtain solutions if axisymmetric geometry is
used.
